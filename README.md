##Challenges  :muscle:

Any project can be improved in many ways but if you do not set a limit, you will never finish it, the hardest part was to determinate were to stop since you can always improve the code and features. 

- Which color to use, add dark mode?
- Not found Page
- Color and design
- Axios of just fetch?
- 100% Hooks rather than clase based components
- Until which stage is ok to stop the optimization? (use of useMemo and other features of hooks)


##Future improvements  :sunglasses:

- Implement more actions for more endpoints
- Login
- Authentication of the user
- Serverside rendering with express or use of next.js instead
- Helmet for protecting the headers
- Use of interceptors for axios
- Images for movies
- Css effects
- Videoplayer
